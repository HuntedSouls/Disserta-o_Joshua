This dissertation uses theories highly recognized in the literature to take a first step in creating a knowledge base about board games. Thus producing an ontology based on the MDA framework \citet{Hunicke2004} and created upon the precepts of UFO \citet{guizzardi_ontological_2005}. For this it investigates more deeply what mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics are, using as much practical knowledge of the people involved as strong theoretical basis such as \citet{ekman_are_basic_emotions_nodate} and \citet{dillon_way_2010}. Finally producing an artifact to be used to improve the understanding of board games.
