\section{Mechanics}
The mechanics ontology will be a restructuring of the board game mechanics ontology created previously in \cite{kritz_buildingOntology}. Although it was created using a different methodology it will be used as a foundation for this mechanics ontology. There is a necessity to adapt this ontology and its description to fit in the UFO standards. It will not change much of the structure of the ontology and the main idea will remain untouched. But this will enrich naturally the ontology as the UFO provides a much larger semantic value than the previously used methodology.

To access the situation all of the nodes in the original ontology will be translated as kinds and subkinds. The is-a relations between the nodes will become generalizations as in the OntoUML specifications they are semantically equal.
