\section{Scope delimitation} 

Important reminder is that OntoBG is not comprehensive and do not claims to become so. To map all possible ramifications of games might be impossible. So this ontology shall be seen as a preliminary work towards understanding and modeling the nature of board games. This scope delimitation is not about removing, it is about gaining. With this, OntoBG can be flexible to attain the most simple needs of a researcher or designer while still being able to grow more complex. Reducing it also turns it more palatable for anyone, not familiar with modeling or ontologies in general, to use.

Fixing the scope on board games is important to lean this work. This is important to achieve the objectives of OntoBG. It permits that the ontology can be increased with ease and simplicity. Also bringing consistency to the knowledge it represents, guaranteeing that OntoBG is easy to understand and use.
