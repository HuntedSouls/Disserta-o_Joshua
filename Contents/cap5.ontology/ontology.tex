\chapter{OntoBG: An ontology of boardgames}

\todo[inline]{Esse texto está precisando de uma boa revisão, eu achei muito difícil de manter a leitura. Tá no nível C, sendo A inglês nativo, B inglês esperado por um não nativo e C tentando atingir o necessário, eu vou sair mudando o que já conseguir resolver}

This chapter covers how the ontology is, specifications, diagrams and restrictions. Intending to cover some important conceptual points inside the model. Also providing insights on how to use it for your own modeling purposes.

OntoBG, by what this works propose, is defined and explained here. Following the directives and scope it does not cover the whole of possibilities. It aims to provide new insight on boardgame modeling and study. 

The ontology is composed of four diagrams. A more general which express the MDA behaviour throughout the ontology. Three others which relay the understanding of each part of the MDA, that is, representing OntoBG-M, OntoBG-D and OntoBG-A. Following, each of them is presented and explained in a section. Finishing the chapter an overall look into the ontology is given. The last three diagrams are too big to fit inside the text and are present in [APENDIX X-> X+2].

Though, before understanding the model, there is one more concept to be created. The relationship of cause and consequence. Why this last creation was needed is fully explained in the first section.
