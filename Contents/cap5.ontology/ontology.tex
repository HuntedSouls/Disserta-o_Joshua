\chapter{OntoBG: An ontology of boardgames}

This chapter covers how the ontology is, specifications, diagrams and restrictions. Intending to cover some important conceptual points inside the model. Also providing insights on how to use it for your own modeling purposes.

OntoBG, by what this works propose, is defined and explained here. Following the directives and scope it does not cover the whole of possibilities. It aims to provide new insight on boardgame modeling and study. 

The ontology is composed of four diagrams. A more general which express the MDA behaviour throughout the ontology. Three others which relay the understanding of each part of the MDA, that is, representing OntoBG-M, OntoBG-D and OntoBG-A. Following each of them is presented and explained in a section, begining with the specific ones and lastly the more generic. Finishing the chapter an overall look into the ontology is given.
