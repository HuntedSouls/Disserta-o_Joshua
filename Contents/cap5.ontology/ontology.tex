\chapter{OntoBG: An ontology of boardgames}


This chapter covers the OntoBG ontology in detail: its specification, diagrams and restrictions, and also reviewing some important conceptual points of the model. It also provides insights on how to use it for different modeling purposes. The diagrams of the model were made using Menthor, the file and program can be found in GitHub\footnote{ \url{https://github.com/HuntedSouls/ONTOBG_Repos}.}.

Following the scope delimitation of this work, it does not cover all the possibilities of board games. It aims to provide new insight on board game modeling and study, not thoroughly explain the domain.

The ontology is represented as four diagrams. One that provides an overview of the MDA structure throughout the ontology, and three others that convey the understanding of each part of the MDA, which are: OntoBG-M, OntoBG-D and OntoBG-A. The following sections, present and explain each of them. At the end of the chapter, an overall perspective of the ontology is given. 



But before understanding the model, there is one more concept to be created: the relationship of cause and consequence. Why it is necessary is fully explained in the next section.
