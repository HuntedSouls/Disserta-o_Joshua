This research aimed to evaluate if it was possible to create a boardgame ontology focused on humans use. To do this it evaluated the different possibilities of ontology creation. How to provide fundamental knowledge on the domain. And more important, how to make this knowledge resonant with the humans interested in this domain.

Analyzing the processes of this ontology creation. From establishing theoretical background to acquiring real users data and then modeling of this information. And the fact that it is complete without any modeling inconsistency. It can be concluded that creating a boardgame ontology for human use is possible and beneficial to the community. Although it need to be improved in many aspects to be fulfilled as a full fledged ontology. This preliminary work indicates that this is a valuable form of knowledge and should not be neglected.
