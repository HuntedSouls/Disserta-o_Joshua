	abstract = {Learning research has argued the importance of providing authentic contexts for learning. However, traditional learning environments are often disconnected from external communities of practice. For example, students might design and carry out scientific experiments that are valuable pedagogically, but do not contribute to science itself. In this study, we used the Game Ontology Project (GOP), a wiki-enabled hierarchy of elements of gameplay used by games studies researchers, in a game design class. Students found it useful for learning. However, encouraging sustained participation was challenging because students tended to view the GOP as a static source, rather than a participatory and editable resource. Expert analysis of the student’s contributions to the ontology found them to be useful and significant. We conclude with thoughts on the importance of these kinds of authentic environments in traditional learning.},

The 51 concepts presented in BoardGameGeek (BGG) as game mechanics are analyzed and arranged in a systemic way in order to build a domain sub-ontology in which the root concept is the mechanics as deﬁned in MDA. The relations between the terms were built from its available descriptions as well as from the authors’ previous experiences. Our purpose is to show that a set of terms commonly accepted by players can lead us to better understand how players perceive the games components that are closer to the designer. The ontology proposed in this paper is not exhaustive. The intent of this work is to supply a tool to game designers, scholars, and others that see game artifacts as study objects or are interested in creating games. However, although it can be used as a starting point for games construction or study, the proposed Game Mechanics Ontology should be seen as the seed of a domain ontology encompassing game mechanics in general.},

By dissecting the implicit value judgments motivating different definitions of ‘‘game,’’ the underlying aesthetic positions can be excavated, revealing a conceptual landscape of the aesthetics of play. Analysis of various definitions for game provided by both professional game designers and academics allows the identification of distinct aesthetic camps. These include (but are not restricted to) victory, problem, reward, imaginative, social, and uncertainty aesthetics. Additionally, a variety of refinements to these positions can be identified. Collectively, these aesthetic positions outline an answer to the question raised by Mary Midgley’s observation that games and art can be unified because they deal with human needs that necessarily have a structure. This article provides a rough sketch of the shape of human play needs and asserts that the unity that can thus be attained must necessarily be diverse.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design, development and analysis of a game for computer literacy. Specifically, the game addresses educational objectives included in the curriculum of non-technological careers, such as the identification and analysis of concepts related to basic hardware components of a computer. These objectives are joined with those of a video game, i.e., live an attractive, motivating and enriching experience. The game has focused on the interaction between the player, who plays the role of a student, a 3D virtual computer, and a character who plays the role of the teacher. The player interacts with the computer and answers a series of inquiries posed by the teacher, all related to components of the 3D computer located in the game scenario, which represents the teacher's office. For each correct answer, the player receives a sounded feedback and messages of encouragement from the teacher, as well as points. Once the player completes each level, the result is stored and can be displayed in a scoreboard. Game analysis has been done using the so-named LM-GM framework, which is an analytical model proposed by GaLA (Game and Learning Alliance, the European Network of Excellence on Serious Games), that maps learning mechanics (LM) to game mechanics (GM). The results of the analysis indicate that the serious game seemly integrates learning objectives as well as LM and GM.},
